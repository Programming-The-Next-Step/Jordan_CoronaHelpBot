# Jordan_CoronaBot

*Jordan is a chatbot that helps you not get crazy in times of corona but if you do, then it is he/she/it that is here for you.*

**Why does Jordan exist?**

We are writing the 6th of May 2020, Berlin, Germany. Humans find themselves in the middle of a pandemic, the corona-virus crisis, that has tremendous consequences for economy, politics, and mental health due to world-wide limitations of social contact. Those limitations forbid for many shops, restaurants, and other venues to open for guests. And more, they forbid for people to meet each other physically in order to avoid spreading the flu-like but slightly more dangerous virus. Current popular hashtags that sum up the phenomenon are #socialdistancing, #stayhome, and #staysafe. 

It seems like the world has moved online. Work meetings, parties, lectures take place in the digital spheres. It is actually more physical than social distancing, when you think about it. 

But what does it do to humans, having to isolate themselves? Studies on self-isolation show that psychopathology follows more quickly than expected, especially for extroverts. Additionally, changes in brain matter occur. So. What can we do to stay sane?
Here is where Jordan comes in. 

**What can Jordan do?**

Jordan could be called a therapist without a license, an advisor, a friend when you feel lonely. In this position, Jordan can be a man or a woman or something else you imagine she/him/it to be. It is possible to talk with Jordan about the following things:

*general*
1. hold smalltalk.
2. complain about your day.
3. tell about your deepest worries, your aching heart, your destroyed soul.
4. tell about how wonderful you feel today.
5. tell about your new crush.

*calming down stuff*

6. curse with Jordan - because, let us be honest, this is what we want the chatbots to do really. 
7. meditating with Jordan.

*corona-related*

6. ask for suggestions to stay sane. This will include going outside for a walk, going to meet a friend or doing some sports. 
Jordan can also remind you of these things.
7. discuss how crazy the media is in times of corona. 
8. discuss how hard it is to be in self-isoltation.


**My Project**

First, I will implement some welcome string that introduces Jordan. In this first opening conversation, there will be some if-else-statements. My goal for this project is to make a chatbot that can give people comfort in times of corona. What I am cutting, if I am short on time is to not implement all modules (conversation types) that I am planning now. But, what I will do, when I have extra time, is to add more modules and things to discuss, and just make Jordan a bit more advanced. 

**My Code**

As language, I will use python. For packages, I am not so sure which ones I will use yet. There are some chatbot packages, but I feel like this defeats the purpose of this exercise. 
I will probably make one function per conversation type. For instance, one for the introduction of Jordan and you. One for the cursing with Jordan, etc. I will also make a function using pygame to develop a browser environment for her.
